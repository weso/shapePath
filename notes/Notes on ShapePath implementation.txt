Notes on ShapePath implementation
=================================

List of errors/problems in test-suite

- nested.shex is not in folder

- In "nested_S0_2_1_valueExpr"
- base:/S0 appears in nested.json but in shapepath is: @<S0>
   - I solved it providing by default a base:// uri to the tests parser (not sure it that's intended)

Definition of evaluateIndex
- Case: 
  If I.type = "TripleConstraint" can we get here?
    If i and i = 1, add I to new value. (I think we should add: I.valueExpr)
